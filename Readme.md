# Backend Project

Welcome to my backend project! This project is a part of my learning journey where I am practicing backend development.

## Overview

In this project, I am focusing on building a complex backend system that involves various database operations. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with backend technologies and improve my skills in creating robust and scalable server-side applications.

## Features

- **Complex Backend Logic**: Implementing intricate backend functionalities to handle various operations.
- **Database Operations**: Working with databases to perform CRUD operations, manage relationships, and ensure data integrity.
- **API Development**: Creating RESTful APIs to interact with the frontend and other services.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring the application can gracefully handle errors and exceptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: For building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js to create APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT**: For secure authentication.
